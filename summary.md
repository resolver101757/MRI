# MRI DICOM Processing for Vision Language Models (VLMs)

## Project Overview

We've created a comprehensive set of tools to extract and process DICOM MRI images for analysis with Vision Language Models (VLMs). These tools help bridge the gap between medical imaging formats and modern AI vision models.

## Challenges Addressed

1. **DICOM Format Complexity**: DICOM is a complex medical imaging format that isn't directly compatible with VLMs.
2. **Image Optimization**: MRI images need proper windowing and normalization for optimal viewing.
3. **Contextual Information**: Preserving metadata and series organization to maintain clinical context.
4. **Patient Privacy**: Anonymizing sensitive patient information.
5. **Data Organization**: Structuring the data to be easily consumed by VLMs.

## Solution Components

### 1. DICOM Analysis (`analyze_dicom.py`)

- Explores DICOM file structure and metadata
- Provides insight into image parameters and series organization
- Useful for initial understanding of the dataset

### 2. DICOM Processing (`extract_dicom_for_vlm.py`)

- Extracts DICOM pixel data and converts to PNG format
- Organizes images by series
- Applies proper windowing for contrast optimization
- Anonymizes patient data
- Preserves metadata in text files
- Creates series-level organization and information

### 3. HTML Report Generation (`create_report.py`)

- Creates visual overview of all series and images
- Provides sample images from each series
- Includes metadata and series information
- Makes it easy to navigate complex MRI studies

### 4. VLM Dataset Preparation (`prepare_for_vlm.py`)

- Creates a VLM-ready dataset
- Allows filtering by series and limiting image counts
- Structures data with JSON metadata
- Provides guidelines for effective VLM prompting

## Workflow

1. **Extract & Process**: Use `extract_dicom_for_vlm.py` to convert DICOM to PNG and organize by series
2. **Visualize**: Use `create_report.py` to create an HTML report for easy visualization
3. **Prepare for VLM**: Use `prepare_for_vlm.py` to create a VLM-ready dataset
4. **Analyze with VLM**: Use the PNG images and associated metadata with a VLM

## Key Features

- **Series Organization**: MRI studies are preserved in their natural organization
- **Proper Windowing**: Applies medical-grade windowing for optimal image contrast
- **Metadata Preservation**: Keeps relevant clinical context with each image
- **Anonymization**: Removes patient identifiers for privacy
- **Flexible Filtering**: Allows selection of specific MRI sequences
- **VLM Integration**: Structured for easy feeding into VLM systems
- **Documentation**: Includes prompting guidelines for effective VLM use

## Example Use Cases

1. **Radiological Analysis**: Feed MRI images to VLMs for preliminary analysis or educational purposes
2. **Research & Development**: Create datasets for fine-tuning or testing VLM capabilities on medical images
3. **Educational Tools**: Develop interactive tools that explain MRI findings using VLMs
4. **Cross-modality Integration**: Combine MRI images with clinical notes for comprehensive analysis

## Results

The processing pipeline successfully:
- Extracted and processed MRI series from DICOM files
- Preserved series organization and metadata
- Created optimized PNG images ready for VLM analysis
- Generated helpful visualization and documentation
- Prepared VLM-ready datasets with filtering capabilities

## Resources Created

1. **Processed Images**: PNG files optimized for VLM input
2. **HTML Report**: Visual overview of all available series
3. **VLM-Ready Dataset**: Filtered and organized dataset with metadata
4. **Documentation**: Guidelines for effective VLM prompting

## Next Steps

1. **Integration**: Use the processed images with your preferred VLM system
2. **Exploration**: Try different prompting strategies using the provided guide
3. **Customization**: Adjust the scripts for specific clinical or research needs
4. **Expansion**: Apply similar processing to other medical imaging modalities

## Conclusion

This toolkit bridges the gap between medical DICOM imaging and modern Vision Language Models, enabling powerful new ways to analyze and understand medical images through AI.
